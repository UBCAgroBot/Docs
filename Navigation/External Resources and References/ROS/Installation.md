For our purposes, we will be using the Humble Hawksbill distribution of ROS 2 as it is built for the Ubuntu 20.04 LTS release Foxy Fitzroy. While the robot will be running on Ubuntu 20.04, ROS 2 can be installed on the major operating systems allowing you to develop without having to run Linux yourself. A full list of supported platforms can be found [here](https://docs.ros.org/en/foxy/Releases/Release-Foxy-Fitzroy.html#supported-platforms).

 

The ROS 2 documentation provides a full installation guide for whichever platform you are using by following the proper links found [here](https://docs.ros.org/en/foxy/Installation.html).

 

NOTE: Make sure that whatever documentation you are following is for the Foxy Fitzroy distribution and not a different release. You can tell by looking at the top left of the page where the distribution logo will be.
