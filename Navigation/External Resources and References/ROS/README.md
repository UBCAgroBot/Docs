This page is an introduction to Robot Operating System (a.k.a. ROS). For more information, the best resource is the [ROS Wiki](http://wiki.ros.org/). [ROS Wiki Tutorials](http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials) section is especially helpful.

[Official ROS Introduction Video By Open Robotics](https://vimeo.com/639236696) is a good starting point to understand ROS. In short, it is a set of tools that makes developing robots easier. It includes tools for communication, logging, visualisation, simulation and many other tasks. There are also ROS packages / wrappers (similar to libraries) for sensors, joysticks, path planning and many other applications. An example is [ROS Wrapper for Intel® RealSense™ Devices](https://github.com/IntelRealSense/realsense-ros) which is for the depth camera we use.

The most important feature of ROS is the communication between nodes (scripts). Nodes run independently and communicate with each other via topics and messages. It is a good strategy because the overall system still runs even if some operations take more time to respond or they fail.

There are two main types of communication in ROS. They are named **publisher-subscriber** and **service-client**.

The publisher-subscriber method is a many-to-many communication. Every node can publish or subscribe to a topic that stores messages. Topics are independent from the nodes that interact with them. The method is asynchronous. The messages stay at the topic until the publisher publishes something new. A subscriber can read the topic anytime. A common use case for the method is sensor data. Multiple nodes can use the same sensor data for different tasks. So, it is beneficial to run the sensor interface in one node, publish the data to a topic and let other nodes subscribe to that topic. [Tutorial For Writing Publisher and Subscriber Nodes](http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/WritingPublisherSubscriber%28python%29). [Tutorial For Running The Nodes](http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/ExaminingPublisherSubscriber).

The service-client method is a request-response communication similar to web requests. One “request” message is sent to the service by the client node and the service sends back a “response” message according to the request. It is a synchronous method. The client waits until it gets a response. One use case might be when a node needs to run once occasionally instead of running continuously. One interesting example that came to my mind is a node with a light ML model that request a heavier model to process sensor data when it is not confident of the results from the light model.

[Tutorial For Writing Service and Client Nodes](http://wiki.ros.org/action/fullsearch/ROS/Tutorials/WritingServiceClient%28python%29).

It is common for a robot to have many nodes. So, roslaunch files are used to automatise the start sequence by starting multiple nodes at the same time. It is also possible to have multiple roslaunch files that are started from one roslaunch file. [A Book Chapter About Roslaunch](https://www.cse.sc.edu/~jokane/agitr/agitr-small-launch.pdf).

ROS includes multiple [Command Line Tools](http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/CommandLineTools). [Rostopic commands](http://wiki.ros.org/rostopic) are quite useful.
